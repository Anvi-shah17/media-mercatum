# üéµ Audio Preview Strategy

## The Challenge

**Visual files** are easy to protect with watermarks, but **audio files** can't have visible watermarks. So how do you create previews that:
- ‚úÖ Allow buyers to evaluate quality
- ‚ùå Prevent use without payment
- ‚úÖ Protect creators' revenue

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Audio Protection Strategies

Your marketplace uses **multiple layers** of audio protection:

### **1. Time Truncation (Primary Protection)**
```
Original Audio: 3:45 (full song/sound)
Preview Audio: 0:30 (first 30 seconds only)
```

**Why it works:**
- ‚úÖ Buyers hear enough to judge quality
- ‚ùå Can't use incomplete audio professionally
- ‚úÖ Creates demand for full version
- ‚ùå Missing the "best parts" (chorus, climax, etc.)

### **2. Audio Watermarks (Secondary Protection)**
```
Beep sounds added every 5 seconds
Frequency: 800 Hz
Duration: 0.15 seconds
Volume: 30% of original audio
```

**Why it works:**
- ‚úÖ Makes preview unusable for production
- ‚úÖ Still allows quality evaluation
- ‚úÖ Clearly marks it as "preview only"
- ‚ùå Cannot be easily removed without degrading audio

### **3. Quality Reduction (Tertiary Protection)**
```
Original: Stereo, high bitrate MP3/WAV
Preview: Mono, WAV format (uncompressed but lower quality)
```

**Why it works:**
- ‚úÖ Reduces file size (faster loading)
- ‚úÖ Lower audio fidelity
- ‚ùå Not suitable for professional use
- ‚úÖ Easy to implement

## üéØ How It's Implemented

### **Preview Generation Flow**

```typescript
// In lib/preview-generator.ts
generateAudioPreview(file) {
  1. Load audio file into AudioContext
  2. Extract first 30 seconds
  3. Add beep watermark every 5 seconds
  4. Convert to mono (mix down channels)
  5. Export as WAV (low quality)
  6. Return preview file
}
```

### **Technical Details**

**Watermark Beeps:**
- Frequency: 800 Hz (high-pitched but not painful)
- First beep at: 3 seconds (after intro)
- Interval: Every 5 seconds
- Duration: 0.15 seconds (quick beep)
- Volume: 30% (noticeable but not overwhelming)
- Envelope: Fade in/out to avoid clicks

**Audio Processing:**
```javascript
// Create beep oscillator
oscillator.frequency.value = 800; // Hz
gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0.3, time + 0.01);

// Mix with original audio
source.connect(offlineContext.destination);
oscillator.connect(gainNode).connect(offlineContext.destination);
```

## üìä Comparison: Different Audio Types

### **Music Tracks**
```
Original: Full 3-5 minute song, stereo, 320kbps
Preview: First 30s, mono, with beeps
```
**Protection**: Users can't hear the chorus, bridge, or ending

### **Sound Effects (SFX)**
```
Original: Clean effect, 1-10 seconds, high quality
Preview: Same length BUT with beep watermark
```
**Protection**: Beep makes it unusable in production

### **Podcast/Voice**
```
Original: Full episode, clear audio
Preview: First 30 seconds, beeps every 5s
```
**Protection**: Can't hear full content, beeps distract

### **Beats/Instrumentals**
```
Original: Full beat, multiple sections, stems
Preview: Intro only, beeps disrupt the flow
```
**Protection**: Missing drop/main sections, beeps break rhythm

---

## üé® Audio Preview UI

### **What Users See/Hear**

```jsx
// In app/asset/[id]/page.tsx
<MediaPreview previewHash={asset.previewHash} mediaType="audio" />

// Renders:
<audio controls>
  <source src="https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/..." />
</audio>
```

**User Experience:**
1. Click play on preview player
2. Hear first 30 seconds
3. Notice beep watermarks every 5 seconds
4. Understand it's a preview
5. Decide to purchase for full version

---

## üí° Alternative Strategies

### **Option A: Voice-Over Watermark**
```
"This is a preview" spoken every 10 seconds
```
**Pros**: Very clear it's a preview  
**Cons**: More intrusive, harder to implement

### **Option B: Periodic Muting**
```
Mute audio for 1 second every 8 seconds
```
**Pros**: Can't be removed easily  
**Cons**: Frustrating user experience

### **Option C: Reversed Audio Segments**
```
Every 10 seconds, reverse 2 seconds of audio
```
**Pros**: Unique protection  
**Cons**: Confusing for buyers

### **Option D: Frequency Filter**
```
Remove certain frequencies (e.g., bass below 100Hz)
```
**Pros**: Subtle but effective  
**Cons**: May not be obvious it's a preview

**‚úÖ Current Choice**: **Time Truncation + Beep Watermarks**
- Best balance of protection vs. usability
- Clear indication it's a preview
- Industry-standard approach

## üîê Security Analysis

### **Can Users Remove the Beeps?**

**Technically:** Possible with audio editing software (e.g., Audacity)
**Practically:** Very difficult and time-consuming

**Why it's still secure:**
1. **Time-consuming**: Removing beeps manually takes 15-30 minutes
2. **Quality loss**: Editing degrades audio quality
3. **Still truncated**: Preview is only 30 seconds anyway
4. **Legal risk**: Watermark removal violates DMCA
5. **Blockchain proof**: Smart contract has ownership record

### **Can Users Record the Preview Multiple Times?**

**If preview is 30s each time:**
- They'd need to listen 8+ times for a 4-minute song
- Still get beeps in all recordings
- Huge effort for low-quality result
- Easier to just buy the full version!

## üìà Industry Comparison

### **How Others Handle Audio Previews:**

| Platform | Strategy | Our Approach |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Spotify** | 30s preview, no watermark | ‚úÖ Similar + watermarks |
| **Beatstars** | Full preview with tags | ‚úÖ Better (truncated) |
| **AudioJungle** | Watermarked full version | ‚úÖ Similar approach |
| **SoundCloud** | Full free streaming | ‚ùå Too permissive |
| **Apple Music** | 90s preview | ‚úÖ More secure (30s) |

**Your marketplace advantage:**
- Shorter previews (30s vs 90s)
- Audio watermarks (beeps)
- Blockchain verification
- Encrypted full versions

---

## üéØ Best Practices for Creators

### **Uploading Music**

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Upload full, high-quality version
- Let preview show intro (usually most impressive part)
- Trust the 30-second limit
- Price appropriately for quality

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Pre-edit your upload
- Worry about preview quality (automatic)
- Upload already-watermarked files

### **Uploading Sound Effects**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Special Case:** Short SFX (< 5 seconds)

If your SFX is very short:
- Preview will be same length BUT with beep
- Beep makes it unusable professionally
- Full version is clean and high-quality

**For longer SFX (> 30s):**
- Preview is first 30 seconds
- Missing the best parts
- Full version includes everything

### **Pricing Strategy**

Based on preview protection:
- **Strong protection** (30s of 5min song) ‚Üí Standard pricing
- **Medium protection** (30s of 1min song) ‚Üí Higher pricing
- **Weak protection** (full SFX with beep) ‚Üí Lower pricing or watermark-free preview

## üîß Technical Configuration

### **Adjust Preview Settings**

Want to change preview behavior? Edit `lib/preview-generator.ts`:

```typescript
// Preview duration (currently 30 seconds)
const previewDuration = Math.min(30, audioBuffer.duration);

// Beep interval (currently every 5 seconds)
const beepInterval = 5;

// Beep frequency (currently 800 Hz)
const beepFrequency = 800;

// Beep volume (currently 30%)
gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0.3, time + 0.01);
```

### **Recommended Ranges**

| Setting | Current | Recommended Range | Effect |
|---------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Duration | 30s | 20-60s | Longer = less secure |
| Beep Interval | 5s | 3-10s | Shorter = more annoying |
| Beep Frequency | 800Hz | 500-1200Hz | Higher = more noticeable |
| Beep Volume | 30% | 20-50% | Higher = more intrusive |
| Beep Duration | 0.15s | 0.1-0.3s | Longer = more disruptive |

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why beeps instead of voice announcements?**  
A: Beeps are:
- Language-independent
- Less intrusive
- Faster to generate
- Smaller file size
- Industry standard

**Q: Can I disable beeps for my uploads?**  
A: Yes, but not recommended. You could:
```typescript
// In preview-generator.ts, comment out beep generation
// for (let time = 3; time < previewDuration; time += beepInterval) {
//   // beep code here
// }
```
But this makes your preview less protected.

**Q: What if my audio is less than 30 seconds?**  
A: The full duration is used, but beeps are added for protection.

**Q: Can buyers share the preview file?**  
A: Yes, but it's only 30 seconds with beeps - not useful professionally.

**Q: What about copyright strikes for using watermarked previews?**  
A: Beeps make it clear it's a preview. Plus, blockchain proves you're the creator.
