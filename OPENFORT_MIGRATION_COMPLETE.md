## üîß Environment Variables Required

Make sure `.env.local` has:
```bash
# Contract
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...

# IPFS (Pinata)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY=gateway.pinata.cloud

# Openfort
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENFORT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHIELD_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Start Hardhat Node
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

### 2. Deploy Contract
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### 3. Update Contract Address
Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `.env.local` with the deployed address.

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Connect Wallet
- Click "Connect Wallet" button
- Choose authentication method:
  - **Google** - Sign in with Google account (creates embedded wallet)
  - **Wallet** - Connect external wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.)

### 6. Switch Networks
- Click the network button (shows current network with colored dot)
- Select from dropdown:
  - **Hardhat Local** (for local development)
  - **Arbitrum Sepolia** (for testnet)

### 7. Copy Wallet Address
- Click on your wallet balance/address
- Click the copy icon next to your address
- See "‚úì Copied to clipboard!" confirmation

### 8. Upload & Mint NFT
- Fill in title, description, media type
- Select file to upload
- Set price in ETH
- (Optional) Add collaborators with revenue splits
- Click "üöÄ Upload & Mint NFT"
- Approve transaction in wallet popup

### 9. Purchase Assets
- Browse asset gallery
- Click on an asset to view details
- Click "Purchase for X ETH"
- Approve payment transaction
- Receive decryption key automatically
- Download full-quality file

## üí∞ Payment Flow

### Minting (Creating Assets)
1. User uploads encrypted file to IPFS
2. Frontend encodes `mintMediaAsset()` call with:
   - IPFS hash (encrypted file)
   - Preview hash (watermarked preview)
   - Price
   - Encryption key
   - Collaborator splits
3. `useSendTransaction` sends transaction
4. Openfort wallet signs and broadcasts
5. NFT minted on-chain

### Purchasing (Buying Assets)
1. Buyer clicks "Purchase for X ETH"
2. Frontend encodes `useAsset(tokenId)` call
3. `useSendTransaction` sends transaction with `value` (payment amount)
4. Smart contract:
   - Receives payment
   - Splits to creator/collaborators automatically
   - Emits `DecryptionKeyReleased` event
5. Frontend watches for event
6. Decryption key received
7. Buyer can download full file

## üîê Security Features

- ‚úÖ **AES-256 Encryption** - All files encrypted before IPFS upload
- ‚úÖ **On-Chain Key Storage** - Decryption keys stored in smart contract
- ‚úÖ **Access Control** - Only buyers receive decryption keys
- ‚úÖ **Openfort Shield** - Embedded wallet security
- ‚úÖ **Watermarked Previews** - Public previews are degraded quality

## üé® UI Features

### Network Selector
- Visual network indicator (colored dot)
- Dropdown with all supported networks
- Shows current network with checkmark
- Displays chain IDs

### Wallet Dropdown
- Shows full wallet address
- Real-time balance for active network
- Copy address button with confirmation
- User avatar (generated from address)
- Disconnect button

### Connect Button
- Gradient purple-to-pink design
- Hover effects and scaling animation
- Opens Openfort modal with auth options

## üìù Code Quality

- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Loading states for all async operations
- ‚úÖ Transaction confirmation tracking
- ‚úÖ Event watching for decryption keys
- ‚úÖ Multiple IPFS gateway fallbacks

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Connect with Google authentication
- [ ] Connect with external wallet (MetaMask)
- [ ] Switch between Hardhat and Arbitrum networks
- [ ] Copy wallet address
- [ ] Check balance updates when switching networks
- [ ] Upload and mint an asset
- [ ] Purchase an asset
- [ ] Receive decryption key
- [ ] Download full-quality file

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Hardhat Node Restart** - Contract address changes, need to redeploy
2. **Network Mismatch** - Ensure wallet is on correct network before transactions
3. **IPFS Gateway Delays** - File downloads may be slow depending on gateway
4. **Gas Estimation** - May need manual gas limit for complex transactions
