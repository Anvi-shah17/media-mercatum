1. **Create a separate wallet for hackathons** - Don't mix with real funds
2. **Keep your secret phrase offline** - Write it on paper, don't save digitally
3. **Use testnet networks** - Always double-check you're on Sepolia, not mainnet
4. **Save some test ETH** - You'll need it for multiple transactions
