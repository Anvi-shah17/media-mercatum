## File Structure

```
app/
  asset/
    [id]/
      page.tsx          # New asset detail page with preview
  api/
    asset/
      [id]/
        route.ts        # API endpoint for fetching asset data

components/
  AssetGallery.tsx      # Updated with clickable cards
```

## Technical Implementation

### Media Type Detection
The preview component intelligently handles different media types:
- Checks metadata for `image` or `animation_url` fields
- Handles both IPFS URLs (`ipfs://`) and regular URLs
- Provides fallback displays if preview isn't available
- Supports video file extensions (.mp4, .webm, .ogg, .mov)

### IPFS Integration
- Fetches metadata from IPFS using Pinata gateway
- Displays metadata attributes if available
- Shows high-quality previews directly from IPFS
- Multiple gateway options for reliability

### Purchase Functionality
- Same smart contract integration as gallery
- Automatic royalty distribution
- Real-time transaction tracking
- Success confirmation

## Example Asset URL

If you have asset #0 minted:
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/asset/0`
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/asset/1` (for asset #1)

## What You'll See

When you click on an asset in the gallery, you'll be taken to a beautiful dedicated page with:

1. **Large preview area** - See/hear your media file
2. **Comprehensive details** - All asset information at a glance
3. **Easy purchasing** - Clear interface to buy/use the asset
4. **IPFS access** - Direct links to view on IPFS gateways
5. **Clean navigation** - Easy return to gallery

## Notes

- The preview automatically adapts to the media type (audio, visual, video)
- If metadata doesn't specify a preview file, you'll see links to IPFS
- All data is fetched from the blockchain and IPFS in real-time
- The page works whether you're connected to a wallet or not (purchase requires wallet)

## Next Steps

1. **Upload more assets** with different media types to test
2. **Click on assets** to see the preview feature
3. **Test IPFS links** to verify file accessibility
4. **Purchase an asset** from the detail page

## Development Notes

- Built with Next.js 14 App Router (dynamic routing)
- Server-side rendering for fast initial load
- Client-side interactivity for wallet connection
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
