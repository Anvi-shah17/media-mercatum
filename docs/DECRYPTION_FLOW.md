# 🔓 Buyer Decryption Flow - Implementation Complete!

## **What Was Implemented**

Your Artist Blockchain Platform now has a **complete end-to-end encryption and decryption system** for buyers!

---

## ✅ Features Added

### **1. Asset Detail Page Enhancements** (`app/asset/[id]/page.tsx`)

#### **Automatic Key Detection:**
- Checks if the current user already has access to the decryption key
- Uses `useReadContract` to call `getDecryptionKey()` from smart contract
- Automatically loads existing key if user has previously purchased

#### **Real-Time Event Listening:**
- Uses `useWatchContractEvent` to listen for `DecryptionKeyReleased` events
- Automatically receives decryption key immediately after purchase
- No page refresh needed - key appears instantly!

#### **Decryption & Download Function:**
```typescript
handleDecryptAndDownload():
1. Downloads encrypted file from IPFS
2. Decrypts using AES-256 with buyer's key
3. Reconstructs original file with correct MIME type
4. Triggers browser download automatically
```

### **2. Smart UI States**

#### **Before Purchase:**
- Shows "💰 Purchase This Asset" card
- Displays file protection info (AES-256)
- Payment amount input
- "🚀 Purchase & Get Decryption Key" button

#### **After Purchase:**
- Shows "✅ You Own This Asset" card
- Displays decryption key (truncated for security)
- "🔓 Download Full File" button
- Green success indicators

#### **During Decryption:**
- Progress messages:
  - "📥 Downloading encrypted file from IPFS..."
  - "🔓 Decrypting file..."
  - "💾 Downloading decrypted file..."
  - "✅ File decrypted and downloaded successfully!"

### **3. Preview vs Full File**

- **Preview:** Shows `previewHash` (unencrypted, public)
- **Full File:** Downloads `ipfsHash` (encrypted, requires key)
- Clear visual separation between preview and full download

---

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### **Seller Side (Already Working):**

1. Upload file → Automatically encrypted
2. Files uploaded:
   - Encrypted full file → IPFS
   - Preview file → IPFS
   - Metadata → IPFS
3. Encryption key stored in smart contract
4. NFT minted successfully

### **Buyer Side (NEW!):**

1. **Browse:** See asset in gallery
2. **View:** Click to see detail page
3. **Preview:** View/play unencrypted preview
4. **Purchase:** 
   - Enter payment amount
   - Click "Purchase & Get Decryption Key"
   - Confirm transaction in MetaMask
5. **Receive Key:**
   - Smart contract emits `DecryptionKeyReleased` event
   - Frontend automatically captures key
   - UI updates to show "You Own This Asset"
6. **Download:**
   - Click "Download Full File" button
   - System downloads encrypted IPFS file
   - Decrypts locally in browser
   - Browser downloads decrypted file
7. **Success!** Full-quality, unencrypted file saved to computer

## 🛡️ Security Features

### **Key Protection:**
- ✅ Keys stored in **private mapping** in smart contract
- ✅ Only accessible via `getDecryptionKey()` with access control
- ✅ Contract checks `hasUsedAsset[tokenId][msg.sender]` before returning key
- ✅ Keys never exposed on blockchain explorer

### **File Protection:**
- ✅ Full files encrypted with **AES-256** before IPFS upload
- ✅ IPFS hash points to encrypted gibberish
- ✅ Preview separate from full file
- ✅ Decryption happens **client-side** (no server needed)

### **Access Control:**
- ✅ Must purchase before getting key
- ✅ Payment verified by smart contract
- ✅ ETH sent to creator automatically
- ✅ Usage tracked on-chain

---

## 🎯 Testing the Flow

### **Test as Seller:**

1. ✅ Upload a file (you already did this!)
2. ✅ Check gallery - see your asset
3. ✅ Click on asset - see detail page
4. ✅ Verify preview shows

### **Test as Buyer:**

1. **Import a different account in MetaMask:**
   - Use Account #1 private key: `0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d`
   - This will be your "buyer" account

2. **Reset MetaMask (if needed):**
   - Settings → Advanced → Reset Account
   - Switch to Localhost 8545

3. **Browse to your uploaded asset:**
   - Go to homepage
   - Click on the asset you uploaded

4. **Purchase:**
   - Should see "Purchase This Asset" card
   - Enter amount (e.g., 0.01 ETH)
   - Click "Purchase & Get Decryption Key"
   - Confirm in MetaMask

5. **Watch the Magic:**
   - Transaction confirms
   - Decryption key automatically appears!
   - Card changes to "You Own This Asset"
   - "Download Full File" button appears

6. **Download & Decrypt:**
   - Click "Download Full File"
   - Watch status messages:
     - Downloading...
     - Decrypting...
     - Downloading decrypted file...
   - Browser downloads the decrypted file!

7. **Verify:**
   - Open the downloaded file
   - Should be the original, unencrypted file
   - Playable audio/video or viewable image

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **New Contract Functions Used:**

```solidity
// Called automatically after checking access
function getDecryptionKey(uint256 tokenId) 
  public view returns (string memory)
{
  require(
    hasUsedAsset[tokenId][msg.sender] || 
    msg.sender == mediaAssets[tokenId].creator ||
    msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId),
    "You must purchase this asset first"
  );
  return decryptionKeys[tokenId];
}
```

### **New Frontend Hooks:**

```typescript
// Read decryption key if user has access
const { data: existingKey } = useReadContract({
  functionName: 'getDecryptionKey',
  args: [BigInt(tokenId)],
});

// Listen for key release event
useWatchContractEvent({
  eventName: 'DecryptionKeyReleased',
  onLogs: (logs) => {
    // Capture key when emitted
  }
});
```

### **Decryption Process:**

```typescript
// 1. Fetch encrypted file
const encryptedBlob = await fetch(ipfsUrl).then(r => r.blob());

// 2. Decrypt with CryptoJS
const decryptedBlob = await decryptFile(
  encryptedBlob, 
  decryptionKey, 
  mimeType
);

// 3. Download
downloadDecryptedFile(decryptedBlob, fileName);
```

   - Added decryption key state management
   - Added event listener for key release
   - Added decrypt & download function
   - Updated UI with purchase/owned states
   - Added real-time status messages

### **No Contract Changes Needed!**
- Contract already had all necessary functions
- `getDecryptionKey()` was already there
- `DecryptionKeyReleased` event was already emitting
- Just needed to use them from frontend!

- **Fix:** Refresh page, key will load from contract

### **Issue: Decryption fails**
- **Cause:** Wrong MIME type or corrupted file
- **Fix:** Check browser console for details
