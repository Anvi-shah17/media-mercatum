---

## **SLIDE 2: The Problem**

### Title: "What's Wrong with Current Platforms?"

### Bullet Points:
- 💸 **30-50% Platform Fees** → Artists lose half their earnings
- ⏰ **30-60 Day Payment Delays** → Cash flow problems
- 🚫 **Centralized Control** → Platform can ban/change terms anytime
- 📉 **No Revenue Transparency** → Hidden fees, unclear splits
- 🔒 **Platform Shutdown Risk** → Lose your entire portfolio

### Visual:
- Side-by-side comparison: Traditional Platform (red X's) vs Your Platform (green checks)

### Speaker Notes:
"Artists are getting squeezed by traditional stock media platforms. AudioJungle takes 50% of every sale. Payment cycles are monthly or longer. And if the platform shuts down—like we've seen with several marketplaces—creators lose everything. This is a $4 billion market with massive inefficiencies."

---

## **SLIDE 3: The Solution**

### Title: "Blockchain-Powered Creative Marketplace"

### Three Pillars (with icons):
1. 🔐 **Military-Grade Encryption**

└─────────────────┘
```

### Key Technologies Listed:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Wagmi v2, RainbowKit
- **Blockchain**: Solidity 0.8.20, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat
- **Storage**: IPFS (Pinata), AES-256 Encryption
- **Indexing**: Envio (GraphQL, PostgreSQL)

### Speaker Notes:
"The architecture is fully decentralized. The frontend is built with Next.js and TypeScript. Smart contracts handle all payments and access control. Files are encrypted and stored on IPFS. And critically—we use Envio's indexer to make browsing fast, solving blockchain's biggest UX problem."

---

## **SLIDE 5: Key Innovation - Dual-File Encryption**

### Title: "Solving IPFS's Public Access Problem"

### Visual: Side-by-side flow diagram

**Left Side - Traditional (Bad):**
```
File Upload → IPFS → Anyone can download ❌
```

**Right Side - Our Solution (Good):**
```
File Upload 
    ↓
AES-256 Encrypt (client-side)
    ↓
Upload to IPFS (encrypted blob)
    ↓
Key stored in Smart Contract
    ↓
Only buyers get key ✅
```

### Additional Features:
- 📁 **Two versions**: Public preview (watermarked) + Encrypted full
- 🔑 **Smart contract releases key** after payment
- 🔓 **Automatic decryption** in browser
- 🛡️ **Files useless without key** on IPFS

### Speaker Notes:
"Here's the breakthrough: IPFS files are normally public to anyone with the hash. I solved this by encrypting files BEFORE upload. The encryption key lives in the smart contract and is only released to buyers. This gives us IPFS's permanence with enterprise-level security."

---

## **SLIDE 6: Envio Integration - Speed Matters**

### Title: "100x Faster Than Traditional Blockchain Queries"

### Performance Comparison Chart:

| Approach | Time for 100 Assets | Technology |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Direct RPC Calls** | 3-5 minutes ❌ | Traditional Web3 |
| **Our Platform (Envio)** | 200ms ✅ | Event Indexing |

### How It Works:
```
Blockchain Event (MediaAssetMinted)
         ↓
    Envio Indexer (real-time)
         ↓
   PostgreSQL Database
         ↓
   GraphQL API
         ↓
  Frontend (instant load)
```

### Stats:
- 🚀 **Sub-second queries** for 1000+ assets
- 📊 **Real-time updates** on new mints
- 🔍 **Flexible filtering** (creator, type, price)
- ⚡ **Production-ready** scalability

### Speaker Notes:
"Performance is critical for user experience. Traditional blockchain queries are SLOW—calling the contract for each asset takes seconds. With Envio, events are indexed in real-time into a database. Our GraphQL API serves 100 assets in 200 milliseconds. That's 100x faster, making the experience feel like Web2 while staying fully decentralized."

---

## **SLIDE 7: Smart Contract Features**

### Title: "Automated Revenue & Access Control"

### Code Snippet (simplified):
```solidity
function useAsset(uint256 tokenId) payable returns (string memory) {
    require(msg.value >= asset.price, "Insufficient payment");
    
    // Distribute payment to collaborators
    _distributeToCollaborators(tokenId, msg.value);
    
    // Release decryption key
    emit DecryptionKeyReleased(tokenId, msg.sender, decryptionKeys[tokenId]);
    
    return decryptionKeys[tokenId];
}
```

### Key Features:
- ✅ **ERC721 NFT Standard** - Industry standard
