# üé§ Hackathon Demo Script

## üéØ Pitch (2 minutes)

### The Problem
"Today's artists face three major challenges:
1. **No proof of ownership** - Anyone can claim they created your work
2. **Middlemen take 30-50%** - Platforms like Spotify, Artlist take huge cuts
3. **No transparency** - You don't know where your work is being used

### The Solution
"We built a blockchain-based platform where artists can:
- Upload audio, visuals, VFX, and SFX with **cryptographic proof of ownership**
- Earn **automatic royalties** via smart contracts - no middlemen
- **Split revenue** with collaborators transparently
- Store files on **IPFS** - decentralized and permanent"

### Tech Stack
"Built with:
- **Frontend**: Next.js on Vercel
- **Storage**: Web3.Storage (IPFS)
- **Blockchain**: Solidity smart contracts on Arbitrum testnet
- **Auth**: Metamask via RainbowKit"

## üé¨ Live Demo (5 minutes)

### Part 1: Upload & Mint (2 min)

**[Show homepage]**
"Here's our platform. Let me show you how an artist uploads their work."

**[Click Connect Wallet]**
"First, we connect our Metamask wallet. This proves we're the creator."

**[Fill upload form]**
- Title: "Lofi Hip Hop Beat #1"
- Description: "Chill beats for studying"
- Media Type: Audio
- Upload file: [Your demo audio file]
- Royalty: 5%

"I'm setting a 5% royalty - so whenever someone uses this beat, I automatically get 5% of what they pay."

**[Add collaborator - optional]**
"Let's say I made this beat with a producer. I can add their wallet and split revenue 70-30."

**[Click Upload & Mint]**
"Now watch what happens:
1. File uploads to IPFS - decentralized storage ‚úÖ
2. NFT mints on Arbitrum blockchain ‚úÖ
3. Smart contract records my ownership ‚úÖ"

**[Show IPFS link]**
"The file is now stored on IPFS - permanent and censorship-resistant."

**[Show transaction on Arbiscan]**
"And here's the blockchain transaction proving I created this at [timestamp]."

### Part 2: Browse & Purchase (2 min)

**[Scroll to Gallery]**
"Now let's browse available assets. Each one shows:
- Media type and creator
- Royalty percentage
- Number of uses
- Total revenue generated"

**[Select an asset]**
"Say I'm a filmmaker and I want to use this sound effect in my video."

**[Enter payment amount: 0.01 ETH]**
"I pay 0.01 ETH to use it."

**[Click Use Asset]**
"Watch what happens:
1. Transaction processes ‚úÖ
2. Royalty automatically goes to the creator ‚úÖ
3. Usage count increments ‚úÖ
4. All recorded on blockchain ‚úÖ"

"The creator gets paid instantly - no waiting 90 days for a platform to process it."

---

### Part 3: Show Collaboration (1 min)

**[Go back to upload form]**
"Let's demonstrate the collaboration feature."

**[Add 2 collaborators]**
- Collaborator 1: 0x1234... (40%)
- Collaborator 2: 0x5678... (30%)
- You: (30%)

"When someone uses this asset, the smart contract automatically splits revenue:
- 40% to collaborator 1
- 30% to collaborator 2
- 30% to me

No manual accounting, no disputes - it's all automated and transparent."

## üéØ Benefits Recap (1 minute)

"So what did we solve?

1. ‚úÖ **True Ownership** - Timestamped on blockchain, can't be disputed
2. ‚úÖ **Automatic Royalties** - No middlemen, instant payments
3. ‚úÖ **Transparency** - See exactly where your work is used
4. ‚úÖ **Collaboration** - Fair, automatic revenue splitting
5. ‚úÖ **Decentralized** - Files on IPFS, not locked in one platform
6. ‚úÖ **Low Fees** - Arbitrum L2 = pennies per transaction

This is how we empower artists in Web3."

## üôã Anticipated Questions

### Q: "What stops someone from uploading someone else's work?"
A: "While anyone can upload, the blockchain timestamp shows who registered it first. Plus, we could add verification systems like digital signatures or reputation scores in future versions."

### Q: "How do you handle large files?"
A: "We use IPFS which is designed for large media files. Files are chunked and distributed across the network. For even larger files, we could integrate with Arweave for permanent storage."

### Q: "What if the artist wants to sell full ownership?"
A: "Great question! Our current version focuses on usage rights, but we could easily add a transfer function to the smart contract for full ownership transfers."

### Q: "How does this compare to platforms like Audius?"
A: "Audius is for music streaming. We're for media assets - sound effects, visual elements, VFX that other creators use in their work. Think Artlist/Splice but decentralized with automatic royalties."

### Q: "Why Arbitrum?"
A: "Low fees and fast transactions. On Ethereum mainnet, each mint might cost $20-50 in gas. On Arbitrum, it's pennies. Perfect for artists who want to upload frequently."

### Q: "What about copyright law?"
A: "Blockchain records are increasingly recognized by courts as proof of creation date and authorship. We're creating a digital paper trail that's tamper-proof. This complements, not replaces, traditional copyright registration."

## üöÄ Future Roadmap

"For the hackathon, we focused on core functionality. Future enhancements:

1. **Subgraph** - Better querying and filtering
2. **Preview Players** - Play audio/video samples before buying
3. **Creator Profiles** - Reputation and portfolio pages
4. **Secondary Market** - Resell usage rights
5. **DAO Governance** - Community decides platform rules
6. **Cross-chain** - Deploy to Polygon, Base, etc.
7. **Mobile App** - Upload and manage on the go
8. **AI Detection** - Flag potentially stolen content"

2. **Demo live, not video** - Shows confidence and handles questions
3. **Have backup** - If network fails, have screenshots ready
4. **Show the transaction** - Watching blockchain confirmations is powerful
5. **Emphasize automation** - "No middlemen, instant payments" resonates
6. **Talk about scale** - "Imagine 1 million artists using this"
7. **End with vision** - Paint picture of future creative economy
