# Media Mercatum

A decentralized NFT marketplace designed for creative professionals to upload, encrypt, and monetize digital assets including audio, visuals, VFX, SFX, and 3D models. Built for the Encode Club Hackathon.

## Overview

Media Mercatum solves critical problems in the creator economy: excessive platform fees (30-50%), delayed payments (30-60 days), and lack of security for digital assets. By leveraging blockchain technology, IPFS storage, and military-grade encryption, this platform enables creators to retain 100% of their revenue with instant, transparent payments.

## Key Features

- **Zero Platform Fees**: Creators keep 100% of revenue, with only gas fees for transactions
- **Instant Payments**: Smart contract automation ensures immediate payment distribution
- **Military-Grade Encryption**: AES-256 encryption protects assets stored on IPFS
- **Dual-File Architecture**: Public previews (watermarked) and encrypted full-quality files
- **Event-Driven Decryption**: Automatic decryption key delivery via blockchain events
- **Collaborative Revenue Splits**: Built-in support for multiple collaborators with automatic distribution
- **Lightning-Fast Indexing**: Envio GraphQL indexer provides sub-second query times (100x faster than direct RPC calls)
- **NFT Standard**: ERC721-compliant tokens with OpenZeppelin security standards

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**
- Next.js 14 (App Router with Server Components)
- TypeScript (100% type coverage)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- React Hot Toast (user notifications)

**Blockchain & Web3**

- Hardhat (development environment)
- Wagmi v2 (React hooks for Ethereum)
- Viem (modern Ethereum library)
- Openfort (embedded wallet authentication & smart accounts)
- RainbowKit (wallet connection UI)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts (security standards)

**Storage & Indexing**
- IPFS via Pinata (decentralized file storage)
- Envio (blockchain event indexer with GraphQL API)
- PostgreSQL (indexed blockchain data)

**Security**
- AES-256-CBC encryption
- Crypto-js library
- Client-side encryption (zero-trust architecture)
- On-chain key management

**Network**
- Sepolia Testnet (development and testing)

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
2. Metamask wallet
3. Sepolia ETH (get from [Sepolia faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com))
4. Pinata API Key (free account at [pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud))
5. WalletConnect Project ID (from [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com))
6. Openfort API Key (from [openfort.xyz](https://openfort.xyz)) - for embedded wallet authentication

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Install Hardhat for Smart Contract Deployment

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @openzeppelin/contracts dotenv
```

### 3. Initialize Hardhat

```bash
npx hardhat init
```

Select "Create an empty hardhat.config.js"

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create `.env` for smart contract deployment:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
SEPOLIA_RPC=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_optional
```

Create `.env.local` for the frontend:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY=gateway.pinata.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENFORT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_openfort_publishable_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHIELD_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_shield_publishable_key
```

### 5. Deploy Smart Contract

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

Copy the deployed contract address and add it to `.env.local`

### 6. Set Up Envio Indexer (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
cd indexer
npm install
npm run codegen
npm run dev
```

The indexer will listen for blockchain events and populate the GraphQL API for fast marketplace queries.

### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Architecture

### System Overview

Media Mercatum uses a three-layer architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer**: Next.js application with wallet integration, file encryption, and IPFS upload
2. **Blockchain Layer**: Solidity smart contract managing NFT minting, payments, and decryption key storage
3. **Storage & Indexing Layer**: IPFS for decentralized file storage, Envio for fast blockchain data queries

### Data Flow

**Creator Upload Flow:**
1. Creator uploads file through web interface
2. File is encrypted client-side using AES-256
3. Encrypted file and watermarked preview uploaded to IPFS
4. NFT minted with IPFS hashes and encryption key stored on-chain
5. Envio indexer picks up `MediaAssetMinted` event
6. Asset appears in marketplace within seconds

**Buyer Purchase Flow:**
1. Buyer browses marketplace (data from Envio GraphQL API)
2. Previews watermarked version of asset
3. Initiates purchase via smart contract
4. Payment automatically distributed to creator(s)
5. Smart contract emits `DecryptionKeyReleased` event
6. Frontend receives key and decrypts full-quality file
7. Buyer downloads decrypted asset

## How It Works

### For Creators

1. **Connect Wallet**: Connect MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
2. **Upload Asset**: Select audio, visual, VFX, SFX, or 3D model file
3. **Set Metadata**: Add title, description, media type, and price
4. **Add Collaborators** (Optional): Specify wallet addresses and revenue split percentages
5. **Mint**: File is automatically encrypted, uploaded to IPFS, and minted as an NFT
6. **Success**: Asset appears in marketplace immediately, ready for purchase

### For Buyers

1. **Browse Marketplace**: Fast-loading gallery powered by Envio indexer
2. **Preview Asset**: Listen to or view watermarked preview
3. **Purchase**: Pay with ETH—100% goes to creator(s)
4. **Receive Key**: Decryption key automatically delivered via blockchain event
5. **Download**: Decrypt and download full-quality original file

## Smart Contract Features

The `MediaAssetNFT.sol` contract implements:

- **ERC721 NFT Standard**: Each asset is a unique, transferable token
- **Encryption Key Management**: Secure on-chain storage of decryption keys
- **Automatic Payment Distribution**: Revenue split among collaborators in single transaction
- **Multi-Collaborator Support**: Flexible revenue sharing with basis point precision
- **Usage Tracking**: Records purchase count and total revenue per asset
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Emits events for indexing and frontend updates
- **Access Control**: Ownable pattern for administrative functions
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient storage patterns and minimal loops

### Key Functions

- `mintMediaAsset()`: Creates NFT with encrypted IPFS references
- `useAsset()`: Handles purchase, distributes payment, releases decryption key
- `getDecryptionKey()`: Returns key only to authorized buyers
- `getAsset()`: Retrieves asset metadata and statistics

## Security Considerations

**Encryption**
- AES-256-CBC encryption applied client-side before IPFS upload
- Unique encryption key per asset
- Keys stored on-chain, only released after payment
- Files are unusable without decryption key

**Smart Contract Security**
- OpenZeppelin audited libraries (ERC721, Ownable)
- Input validation on all public functions
- Reentrancy protection on payment functions
- Events for transparency and auditability

**Best Practices**
- Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` files
- Keep private keys secure and never share them
- Use testnet for development and testing
- Conduct security audit before mainnet deployment

## Testing on Sepolia Testnet

1. Get test ETH from [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com)
2. Switch MetaMask to Sepolia network
3. Deploy contract and interact with the application
4. All transactions are free (except gas fees paid in test ETH)
